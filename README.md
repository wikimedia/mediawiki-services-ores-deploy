This is the production deployment repository for the ORES service.

<blockquote>
⚠️ Warning: As of late 2023, the ORES infrastructure is being deprecated by the
WMF Machine Learning team, please check
https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/ORES for more info.

While the code in this repository may still work, it is unmaintained, and as
such may break at any time. Special consideration should also be given to
machine learning models seeing drift in quality of predictions.

The replacement for ORES and associated infrastructure is Lift Wing:
https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning/LiftWing

Some Revscoring models from ORES run on the Lift Wing infrastructure, but they
are otherwise unsupported (no new training or code updates).

They can be downloaded from the links documented at:
https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning/LiftWing#Revscoring_models_(migrated_from_ORES)

In the long term, some or all these models *may* be replaced by newer models
specifically tailored to be run on modern ML infrastructure like Lift Wing.
